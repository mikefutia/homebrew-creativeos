      Before starting the connector:
        1. Make sure Claude Code is installed and signed in.
        2. In Creative OS, open Settings > Claude Code and generate a setup code.
        3. Run: creativeos-connector pair
        4. Run: claude setup-token
        5. Run: creativeos-connector auth
        6. Run: brew services restart creativeos-connector

      If Terminal says claude is not found:
        ~/.claude/local/claude setup-token

      To connect provider accounts through Claude Code MCP:
        Open Creative OS > Settings > Connections, expand the provider, then click Add.
        Creative OS opens a local sign-in helper for providers that need Claude Code MCP OAuth.
